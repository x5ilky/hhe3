William: "HOLY! I GOT IT!"
William shoots out of the rear window with adrenaline fueled precision
and eliminates all the zombies just in time. You and William get out
of the car just in time, with the entire car still being on the road.
You both take some time to process what just happened. Process the dead
Zombies.
Process the near-death experience.
And nearly even settle to process the entire apocalypse situation,
but William quickly shouts:

"Dude! Donâ€™t dead zombies attract more live ones? WE GOTTA MOVE BEFORE WE GET INTO ANOTHER SITUATION LIKE THIS!"

You two hurry back into the car and drive back to the bunker safely.
