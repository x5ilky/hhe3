William: "I-I GOT THE GUN!"
William pulls back the automatic stashed in the car for the apocalypse
and shoots out the window. Unfortunately, the car was already too tilted
Before the zombies were dead.

You and William desperately push on the side of the car instinctively to
somehow try to stop it from tilting, but to no avail. The car tilts off
Bridge. Will grabbed it too late.
